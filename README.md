# My Neighborhood Map

## Final project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.com

### Target of the project:

Create a react application using two APIs one is Google maps and the other one was up to me, I chose to use Foursquare's API to find information about the places.

The requirements:
* Add at least 5 places to the map
* Show a list of the places
* The list can be filtered
* Clicking on the list shows something about the place (I chose to make it disappear after 2 seconds)
* Clicking on a marker shows something about the place (Same info as the one above, this time the information stays unless we open a different one or manually close it)
* A11y Friendly
* Responsive for mobile and Web
* Include a service worker (Used react's default)
